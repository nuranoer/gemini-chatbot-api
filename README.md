# Chatbot-ai
In modern web development, integrating AI into applications has become increasingly accessible thanks to tools like Google’s Gemini API. Gemini AI models are capable of generating rich, contextual, and human-like responses to user prompts. When applied to a chatbot system, these models replace traditional rule-based logic with intelligent, real-time responses that adapt to each user’s input.The integration process typically involves three main steps:1. Capturing user input on the frontend.2. Sending the input to a backend service.3. Using the AI model to generate and return a response.

n our hands-on project, we implemented this flow using a Vanilla JavaScript frontend and a Node.js + Express backend. When the user submits a message through the chat form, the frontend sends a POST request to the /api/chat endpoint on the backend. The backend then uses the Gemini SDK’s generateContent() method to prompt the AI model with the user’s message. Once Gemini returns the response, it’s sent back to the frontend and displayed in the chat interface.This architecture allows us to keep the AI logic on the backend—ensuring security and scalability—while delivering a seamless conversational experience to the user.
